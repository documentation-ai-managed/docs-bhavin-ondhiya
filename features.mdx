## Document Structuring

Create a clear hierarchy for your documentation using nested pages and frontmatter. You define structure with YAML frontmatter and MDX headings, enabling easy navigation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Frontmatter" icon="file-text">
    Start every page with YAML to set metadata.

````mdx
---
title: My Page
description: Page summary here
---
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Headings" icon="heading">
    Organize content with H2, H3, and H4 for hierarchy.

    ```mdx
    ## Main Section

    ### Subsection

    Content details here.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Pages" icon="link">
    Connect sections with internal links like `[Next Page](/features#project-organization)`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Always start body content with H2 headings to maintain proper hierarchy without H1.
</Callout>

## Project Organization

Organize multiple documentation sets into projects. You assign pages to projects, customize sidebars, and switch views dynamically.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Folder View" icon="folder">
    View pages in a tree structure.

    ```
    docs/
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── features/
    │   └── organization.mdx
    └── api/
        └── endpoints.mdx
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tag View" icon="tag">
    Filter by tags for cross-project organization.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
    ````javascript
    // Add tags in frontmatter
    ---
    tags: ["feature", "guide"]
    ---
    ````
    ````python
    # Use tags for filtering
    tags = ["feature", "guide"]
    ````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Filtering

Bhavin Ondhiya's search scans full-text across all projects. You apply filters by tags, dates, or types for precise results.

| Feature | Description | Example Filter |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Full-Text Search | Matches keywords in content | `authentication` |
| Tag Filter | Narrows by labels | `tags:api` |
| Date Range | Recent changes only | `updated:>2024-01-01` |
| Project Scope | Limit to one project | `project:docs-v2` |

<Callout kind="info">
  Use quotes for exact phrases like `"version control"`.
</Callout>

## Version Control Basics

Track changes to your docs with built-in version history. You commit changes, compare diffs, and restore previous versions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Edit Page] --> B[Commit Changes]
    B --> C[View History]
    C --> D[Compare Diffs]
    D --> E[Restore Version]
    E --> A
```
